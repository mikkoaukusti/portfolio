      "The cooperation between ATR Soft Oy and TUAS was targeted towards systems integrations in the health care industry. The cooperation consisted of a three day course of IRIS for Health, arranged by InterSystems and two separate stages. The stage 1 consisted a front-end development for an IRIS back-end port reservation application. The stage 2 consisted learning development on IRIS platform by creating an integration. I was the main coder of TUAS group, as I had the most programming knowledge and interest. During development, ATR Soft made a blog post about our cooperation on their website.â€‹",
